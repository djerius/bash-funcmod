    funcmod - CLOS like modifiers for bash functions

SYNOPSIS
     source funcmod.sh

     func () { echo "func" ; }

     afunc () { echo "after" ; }

     rfunc () {
       local orig=$1
       shift

       echo "before orig"

       # invoke original function and save return value
       local rval=0
       $orig "$@" || rval=$?

       echo "after orig"

       # return original return value
       builtin return $rval

DESCRIPTION
    funcmod provides CLOS-like modifiers for bash functions. It wraps the
    original function and calls the user specified functions at the
    specified entry points when the original function is invoked.

    A function may be modified more than once (and by the same modifier).

FUNCTIONS
  before
      before func1 [func2 ... ]   modifier

    The function `modifier' is called before the function it is modifiying.
    Its return value is totally ignored. It receives the same arguments as
    the function it is modifying. The modifier cannot change the arguments
    passed to the original function.

  after
      after func1 [func2 ... ]   modifier

    The function `modifier' is called after the function it is modifiying.
    Its return value is totally ignored. It receives the original arguments
    passed to the function it is modifying.

  around
      around func1 [func2 ... ]   modifier

    `modifier' is called instead of the function it is modifying. The name
    of the function that it is modifying is passed as the first argument
    (this will be a mangled name).

    This modifier may be used to alter the arguments passed to the function.

    Be careful to pass on the return value of the original function if
    required (see the SYNOPSIS for one approach).
